Metastore Viewer ‚Äì Project Plan
üèÜ Project Goals
The Metastore Viewer is a web-based tool for browsing and managing metadata of Parquet, Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi tables stored in S3, Azure Object Store, or MinIO. The project provides an easy way to explore table schemas, partitions, and configurations via a FastAPI-based backend and an optional web UI.

Metastore Viewer ‚Äì Development Plan

Backend Development
1. Setting up the FastAPI project structure to ensure modularity and maintainability.
2. Implementing API endpoints for retrieving metadata from Parquet, Iceberg, Delta, and Hudi tables.
3. Connecting to S3, Azure Blob Storage, and MinIO to fetch and manage metadata from various object stores.
4. Adding caching and indexing mechanisms to enhance performance and reduce query latency.

Web UI Development
1. Building a frontend interface to provide an interactive metadata exploration experience.
2. Implementing search and filtering functionalities to allow users to refine metadata queries efficiently.

Testing & Optimization
1. Conducting unit and integration tests to validate API functionality and metadata retrieval accuracy.
2. Optimizing query performance to minimize response times and improve scalability.
